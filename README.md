# Project Title

Our own ethereum token

## Description

The `MyToken` contract defines a basic token with the name "META" and abbreviation "Metacrafters". It utilizes a mapping to keep track of token balances for each address. The `mint` function increases the total token supply and adds tokens to a specified address. Conversely, the `burn` function reduces the total supply and removes tokens from an address if the balance is sufficient.

## Getting Started

### Installing

To run this program remix.ide should be used only because it requires some functionality that only remix can provide.

### Executing program

Just turn on auto compile or can manually compile the code in the file titles at 'ETH Project' in the repository and then after compilation in the deploy section use any of the available addresses and then play with the number of tokens by minting and burning them and see if it works.
